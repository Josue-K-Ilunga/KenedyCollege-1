# ðŸ“– The Founding of Kenedy College
In 2025, three passionate and ambitious students â€” Bailey Kennedy, Olajuwon Daniel Abbatty, and JosuÃ© Kashila Ilunga â€” were enrolled in the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) program at MITT (Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology). As classmates, they shared not only a love for technology, but also a dream: to create a learning environment that empowered others to build a future through tech.

While studying at MITT, they often collaborated on projects, tutored peers, and dreamed aloud about how learning should be â€” practical, inclusive, and future-focused.

After graduating, instead of taking separate job offers, they took a bold step. With limited resources but strong determination, they founded a small independent school they named Kenedy College â€” blending their names and vision.

The mission of Kenedy College was simple:

To provide affordable, hands-on, and accessible technology education for future innovators.

What started as a one-room classroom with a few second-hand computers soon began to attract students â€” drawn by the founders' commitment, energy, and real-world approach to ICT training.

Today, Kenedy College continues to grow, inspired by the same values that brought three students together in a classroom â€” and turned a shared dream into a living legacy
